# Data Compose Project

## Project Overview

Data Compose is a web application that integrates with n8n (a workflow automation tool) to process and transform data. The application consists of a web frontend that communicates with n8n via webhooks, along with a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a Docker-based application with three main services:

1. **NGINX Web Server**: Serves the web frontend and proxies requests to the n8n service
2. **n8n Workflow Engine**: Handles automation workflows and webhook processing
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores data for n8n and application state

```

## Configuration

### Docker Configuration

The application uses Docker Compose for container orchestration:

- `docker-compose.yml`: Main configuration file that defines three services:
  - `web`: NGINX web server (port 8080)
  - `db`: PostgreSQL database
  - `n8n`: n8n workflow automation (port 5678)

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration is stored in the `.env` file:

```
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
DB_NAME=your_db_name
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_secure_encryption_key_here
```

### NGINX Configuration

The NGINX server (`nginx/conf.d/default.conf`) is configured to:

1. Serve static web content from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
2. Proxy requests to n8n at `/n8n/`
3. Proxy webhook requests to n8n at `/webhook/`

## Web Frontend

The web frontend is now a Single Page Application (SPA) with seamless navigation:

1. **Home Section**: Welcome page with system testing and feature overview
2. **AI Chat Section**: Real-time chat interface with DeepSeek R1 via webhooks
3. **Workflows Section**: n8n workflow management and monitoring

### Frontend Configuration

Frontend configuration is managed in `website/js/config.js` which defines:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  WEBHOOK_ID: "c188c31c-1c45-4118-9ece-5b6057ab5177",  
  WEBHOOK_URL: `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/webhook/c188c31c-1c45-4118-9ece-5b6057ab5177`
};
```

## n8n Integration

The project uses n8n for workflow automation. Key integration points:

1. **Webhook Endpoints**: The application communicates with n8n via webhooks
2. **Custom Nodes**: The project includes a custom n8n node for DeepSeek integration
3. **Workflow Storage**: Workflows are stored in the n8n data volume
4. **Workflow Exports**: Pre-configured workflows available in `workflow_json/`

### Available Workflows

#### web_UI_basic
Basic workflow that connects the web interface to the DeepSeek AI node:
- Receives webhook requests from the frontend
- Processes messages through the DeepSeek R1 node
- Returns AI responses to the chat interface
- Import via n8n interface: Menu → Import from file → Select `workflow_json/web_UI_basic`

# Development Session Analysis and Discoveries

## Critical Discoveries Made During Development

### 1. Container Orchestration Issues
- **n8n Crash State Problem**: The primary issue preventing n8n startup was not encryption key mismatches, but a corrupted crash state in the data volume
- **Health Check Failures**: Multiple Docker health checks were failing due to:
  - PostgreSQL health check looking for wrong database name (`vel` vs `mydb`)
  - n8n health check using `curl` command not available in container
  - Solution: Use `netstat` for simple port listening verification

### 2. Credential Management Revelations
- **"Placeholder" credentials are actually working credentials**: The values in `.env` like `"your_secure_password_here"` are the real functional passwords, not placeholders
- **Local-only security model**: System works locally with simple credentials but is intentionally not production-ready for cloud deployment
- **Environment variable interpolation**: Docker Compose correctly reads and applies `.env` values to containers

### 3. Frontend Architecture Problems
- **Broken relative path references**: HTML files had inconsistent `../` path structures causing CSS and JS loading failures
- **Mixed styling approaches**: Combination of external CSS (`styles.css`) and inline styles created conflicts
- **JavaScript dependency failures**: UI changes broke chat functionality because JS expected specific DOM elements (`.sidebar`, `.toggle-btn`)

### 4. Git Repository Security
- **False security alarm**: Initial panic about `.env` in git was incorrect - `.gitignore` worked correctly from the beginning
- **Proper secret management**: Only `.env.example` was committed; real `.env` was always protected

## Interface Improvements Needed

### Immediate Technical Fixes Required

1. **JavaScript Dependency Resolution**
   - Chat functionality breaks when sidebar elements are removed
   - Need to decouple chat.js from specific UI layout requirements
   - Implement defensive programming for missing DOM elements

2. **CSS Architecture Overhaul**
   - **Current Problem**: ~150 lines of identical CSS duplicated across 3 HTML files
   - **Maintenance Issue**: Color scheme changes require editing 9+ locations
   - **Solution Needed**: Extract common styles to shared stylesheet with CSS custom properties

3. **Navigation Consistency**
   - Three different navigation patterns across pages create confusing UX
   - Need unified navigation component approach
   - Consider single-page application or template system

### Long-term Architectural Considerations

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Current copy-paste approach will not scale beyond 3-4 pages
   - Need shared header/navigation/footer components
   - Consider build system for component reuse

2. **State Management**
   - Chat functionality tightly coupled to specific DOM structure
   - Need abstraction layer for UI-independent functionality
   - Consider separating business logic from presentation

3. **Development Workflow**
   - No separation between development and production builds
   - Missing optimization pipeline for CSS/JS
   - Need hot-reload capability for faster iteration

## Lessons Learned for Future Agents

### Debugging Methodology Insights

1. **Fresh Perspective Technique**
   - When stuck in solution loops, step back completely and test basic assumptions
   - The "encryption key" issue was solved by testing fresh container vs. existing volume
   - Sometimes the simplest explanation (crash state) is correct

2. **Assumption Validation**
   - Never assume "placeholder" values are non-functional without testing
   - Always verify what's actually in git history rather than assuming security breaches
   - Check actual container environment variables, not just configuration files

3. **Systematic Investigation**
   - When user says "look at website folder," focus specifically on that request
   - Don't get distracted by tangential issues (security concerns) when user has specific intent
   - Test one change at a time to isolate cause-and-effect relationships

### Human-AI Collaboration Patterns

1. **Trust Building Through Transparency**
   - Admitting when stuck in loops builds credibility
   - Explaining reasoning allows human to redirect effectively
   - Acknowledging mistakes openly prevents defensive behavior

2. **User Expertise Recognition**
   - User often knows the codebase better than initial analysis reveals
   - When user suggests "check X," they usually have specific knowledge
   - Gut instincts about broken functionality are often accurate

3. **Iterative Problem Solving**
   - Break complex problems into small, verifiable steps
   - Maintain working state between experiments
   - Revert changes when they break functionality

### Testing and Validation Strategies

1. **Functional Testing Before Refactoring**
   - Always verify current working functionality before making changes
   - Document which parts work vs. which are broken
   - Maintain regression capability throughout development

2. **End-to-End Impact Assessment**
   - UI changes can break backend integrations (chat.js dependency failure)
   - Consider full user journey when making interface modifications
   - Test actual user workflows, not just visual appearance

3. **Git Workflow Management**
   - Commit working states frequently for easy rollback
   - Use meaningful commit messages that explain "why" not just "what"
   - Verify security implications before pushing to public repositories

### Code Quality Recognition

1. **Maintainability vs. Functionality Trade-offs**
   - Working code with duplication beats broken "clean" code
   - Recognize when perfectionism hinders progress
   - Balance immediate needs with long-term architecture

2. **Progressive Enhancement Philosophy**
   - Start with working solution, then improve systematically
   - Don't rebuild everything at once
   - Preserve core functionality during refactoring

### Communication Effectiveness

1. **Precise Language Importance**
   - "Fix the paths" is clearer than "fix the website"
   - Specific technical terms reduce ambiguity
   - Ask for clarification when instructions seem incomplete

2. **Problem Escalation Recognition**
   - Know when to admit being stuck rather than cycling through similar approaches
   - Accept redirection gracefully when taking wrong approach
   - Value user feedback as course correction, not criticism

This session demonstrated that successful AI-human collaboration requires technical competence, debugging methodology, honest communication, and the humility to admit mistakes and learn from redirections.

# Frontend Architecture Transformation

## The Herculean Challenge - Complete Redesign

Following the analysis of maintainability issues, a complete frontend reconstruction was undertaken to create an elegantly simple, extensible application framework while preserving 100% of existing functionality.

## New Architecture Overview

### Single Page Application Design
The frontend was completely rebuilt as a unified SPA with the following structure:

```
website/
├── index.html              # Single entry point with all sections
├── css/
│   ├── app.css            # Unified CSS framework with design system
│   └── styles.css         # Legacy CSS (preserved but unused)
├── js/
│   ├── app.js             # Extensible application framework
│   └── config.js          # Preserved webhook configuration
├── favicon.ico            # Unchanged
```

### Core Design Principles Applied

1. **Occam's Razor**: Simplest solution that preserves all functionality
2. **Zero Code Duplication**: Eliminated ~150 lines of repeated CSS across files
3. **Extensibility First**: Built for easy addition of new sections and features
4. **Defensive Programming**: Graceful handling of missing DOM elements
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with JavaScript disabled for basic navigation

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Framework (`css/app.css`)
- **Design System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Component-Based**: Reusable classes for buttons, cards, layout elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation support

### JavaScript Architecture (`js/app.js`)
- **Class-Based Design**: `DataComposeApp` class managing application state
- **Section Registration System**: Modular approach for adding new functionality
- **Preserved Functionality**: All original webhook, chat, and n8n integrations intact
- **Event Management**: Centralized navigation and interaction handling

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- **Semantic Markup**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements
- **Accessible Navigation**: ARIA-compliant tab-based interface
- **Content Sections**: Each major feature as a toggleable section
- **Progressive Loading**: Sections load content only when activated

## Functionality Preservation Verification

### Original Features Maintained
✅ **Chat System**: Webhook URL preserved exactly (`c188c31c-1c45-4118-9ece-5b6057ab5177`)  
✅ **Message Handling**: Enter key support, status updates, error handling  
✅ **n8n Integration**: Health check endpoint (`/n8n/healthz`) and workflows API  
✅ **Connection Testing**: System status verification functionality  
✅ **Workflows Management**: Integration with `/n8n/rest/workflows` and interface links  

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Seamless Navigation**: Tab-like switching between sections without page reloads
- **Consistent Design**: Unified visual language across all functionality
- **Improved Performance**: Single page load, smooth CSS transitions
- **Better Mobile Support**: Responsive design optimized for all screen sizes

## Extensibility Features

### Easy Section Addition
New sections can be added programmatically:

```javascript
window.app.addSection('settings', 'Settings', 'fas fa-cog', 
    '<h2>Settings</h2><p>Configuration options...</p>',
    { onShow: () => initializeSettings() }
);
```

### Theme Customization
Colors and fonts can be changed globally via CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2c3e50;
    --secondary-color: #3498db;
    /* Change these to retheme entire application */
}
```

### Modular JavaScript
The section registration system allows for independent feature development:

```javascript
app.registerSection('newFeature', {
    onShow: () => loadNewFeature(),
    onHide: () => cleanupNewFeature()
});
```

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### Maintainability Improvements
- **Single Source of Truth**: One CSS file for all styling
- **Centralized Navigation**: One navigation system for all sections
- **Consistent Patterns**: Reusable components and standard interactions
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct layers for presentation, behavior, and data

### Development Efficiency Gains
- **Faster Iteration**: Changes to one section don't affect others

The transformation successfully converted a collection of scattered, duplicated files into a cohesive, maintainable, and extensible application framework while preserving every aspect of the original functionality. The new architecture embodies the principle that the best solutions are both powerful and simple.

# Hierarchical Summarization Navigation

## Overview
The Hierarchical Summarization feature provides an advanced visualization and navigation system for exploring document hierarchies with multiple levels of summarization.

## Navigation Features

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Level-based Color Coding**: Each hierarchy level has distinct colors:
  - Level 0 (Source Documents): Light blue (#e3f2fd)
  - Level 1 (Initial Summaries): Light green (#e8f5e9)
  - Level 2 (Intermediate Summaries): Light orange (#fff3e0)
  - Level 3 (Final Summary): Light purple (#f3e5f5)
- **Dynamic Node Sizing**: Higher-level summaries appear larger for visual emphasis
- **Active Path Highlighting**: Shows the relationship path between nodes

### Navigation Methods

1. **Arrow Navigation**
   - Left/Right arrows: Navigate between hierarchy levels (parent/child relationships)
   - Up/Down arrows: Navigate between siblings at the same level
   - Hover tooltips show preview of target nodes

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `←` Navigate to parent level (toward final summary)
   - `→` Navigate to child level (toward source documents)
   - `↑` Previous sibling at same level
   - `↓` Next sibling at same level
   - `Home` Jump directly to final summary
   - `End` Jump to first source document
   - `Ctrl+/` Open search dialog

3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - Shows current path from final summary to current node
   - Click any breadcrumb to jump directly to that node
   - Color-coded breadcrumbs match level colors

4. **Quick Jump Dropdown**
   - Access via compass icon in top-right
   - Nodes organized by hierarchy levels
   - Shows preview of each node's content
   - Searchable dropdown for quick access

5. **Search Functionality**
   - Full-text search across all nodes
   - Highlighted matches in visualization
   - Context preview showing surrounding text
   - Click search results to navigate directly

### Additional Features
- **Minimap**: Interactive overview showing entire hierarchy with current viewport
- **Zoom/Pan**: Mouse wheel zoom, click and drag to pan
- **URL Bookmarking**: Direct links to specific nodes via URL hash
- **Progressive Loading**: Handles large hierarchies efficiently
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Navigation Bug Fix
Fixed critical navigation logic where left/right arrow directions were reversed. The navigation now correctly:
- Left arrow navigates to parent nodes (higher level, toward final summary)
- Right arrow navigates to child nodes (lower level, toward source documents)

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced zoom/pan operations for smoother interaction
- Smart viewport culling for large hierarchies
- Efficient path highlighting using D3.js selections

### CSS Architecture
All hierarchy levels use CSS custom properties for easy theming and consistency across the visualization.

# DeepSeek Custom Node Details

## Node Architecture

The custom DeepSeek node (`n8n-nodes-deepseek`) provides AI integration capabilities:

### Features
- **Two Operations**: Generate Text and Chat modes
- **Model**: DeepSeek-r1:1.5B via Ollama API
- **Advanced Options**: Temperature, max tokens, thinking visibility
- **Custom Endpoint**: Configurable Ollama server URL

### Technical Implementation
- **TypeScript Source**: `nodes/Dsr1/Dsr1.node.ts`
- **Build System**: TypeScript + Gulp for assets
- **API Endpoint**: `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/generate`
- **Response Processing**: Parses `<think>` tags for reasoning visibility

### Development Commands
```bash
cd n8n/custom-nodes/n8n-nodes-deepseek
npm run dev    # Watch mode
npm run build  # Production build
npm run lint   # Code quality
```

### Known Limitations
1. Uses `/api/generate` endpoint (stateless, no conversation memory)
2. TypeScript type definitions need updating for latest n8n

### Future Improvements
1. Add streaming response support
2. Implement token usage tracking
3. Add model selection dropdown
4. Consider frontend-based conversation history management

# Haystack/Elasticsearch Integration

## Overview

The project includes a comprehensive document processing system using Elasticsearch and a Haystack-inspired implementation for AI-powered document analysis, specifically designed for legal documents.

**Pipeline Design**: Haystack works WITH HierarchicalSummarization, not instead of it:
1. HierarchicalSummarization processes documents → PostgreSQL
2. Haystack imports from PostgreSQL → Elasticsearch for search

### Architecture

1. **Elasticsearch Service** (Port 9200)
   - Document storage with BM25 and vector search capabilities
   - Custom legal document analyzer
   - Hierarchical document tracking

2. **Haystack API Service** (Port 8000)
   - FastAPI-based REST API
   - Document ingestion with embedding generation
   - Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector)
   - Document hierarchy management

3. **Custom n8n Node** (`n8n-nodes-haystack`)
   - Full integration with n8n workflows
   - 8 Operations: Import from Previous Node, Search, Get Hierarchy, Health Check, Batch Hierarchy, Get Final Summary, Get Complete Tree, Get Document with Context

### Important Implementation Note

**Current Active Service**: `haystack_service.py` (NOT haystack_service_simple.py which doesn't exist)
- Uses direct Elasticsearch client (not full Haystack library)
- Running with FastAPI development server (--reload flag, not production-ready)
- **7 endpoints** implemented (missing batch_hierarchy)
- **8 operations** in the n8n node (but "Batch Hierarchy" will fail as endpoint doesn't exist)

### Key Features

1. **Document Hierarchy System**
   - 4-level hierarchy: Source → Chunks → Intermediate Summaries → Final Summaries
   - Parent-child relationship tracking
   - Metadata preservation through all levels

2. **Search Capabilities**
   - **Hybrid Search**: Combines BM25 and vector search
   - **Vector Search**: Using BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 embeddings
   - **BM25 Search**: Traditional keyword search with legal analyzer

3. **API Endpoints** (7 implemented)
   - `POST /import_from_node` - Import documents from n8n node
   - `POST /search` - Multi-modal search (BM25/Vector/Hybrid)
   - `POST /hierarchy` - Get document relationships
   - `GET /health` - Service health status
   - `GET /get_final_summary/{workflow_id}` - Get workflow's final summary
   - `GET /get_complete_tree/{workflow_id}` - Get full hierarchical tree
   - `GET /get_document_with_context/{document_id}` - Get document with navigation context
   - ~~`POST /batch_hierarchy`~~ - NOT IMPLEMENTED (defined in node but missing from service)

### Quick Test

```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq

# Import a test document (note: /ingest endpoint doesn't exist, use n8n workflow instead)
# Documents should be imported via the n8n Haystack node's "Import from Previous Node" operation

# Search documents
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "legal document", "top_k": 5, "use_hybrid": true}'
```

### Setup Commands

```bash
# From data_compose/ root directory
# Start all services including Haystack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f n8n/docker-compose.haystack.yml up -d

# Or use the convenience script
cd n8n && ./start_haystack_services.sh
```
