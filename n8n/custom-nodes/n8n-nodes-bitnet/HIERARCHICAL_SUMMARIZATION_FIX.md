# BitNet Hierarchical Summarization Connection Fix

## Problem
The BitNet node was not connecting properly to n8n's hierarchical summarization node because:

1. **Interface Mismatch**: The hierarchical summarization node is a LangChain-based node that expects a specific interface with a `response` property containing the model object.
2. **Compilation Issues**: The TypeScript compilation produced incorrect string literals instead of proper NodeConnectionType constants.
3. **Missing LangChain Compatibility**: The BitNet node only returned an `invoke` function, not the expected LangChain-compatible structure.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed NodeConnectionType Constants
Updated the compiled JavaScript to use proper n8n-workflow constants:
```javascript
inputs: [{ type: n8n_workflow_1.NodeConnectionType.Main }],
outputs: [
    { type: n8n_workflow_1.NodeConnectionType.Main },
    { 
        type: n8n_workflow_1.NodeConnectionType.AiLanguageModel,
        displayName: 'Model'
    }
]
```

### 2. Updated supplyData Method
Modified the `supplyData` method to return a LangChain-compatible structure:
```javascript
async supplyData() {
    // ... server configuration ...
    
    const model = {
        invoke: async (params) => {
            // ... implementation ...
        }
    };
    
    // Return in LangChain-compatible format
    return {
        response: model,        // For LangChain nodes
        invoke: model.invoke    // For backward compatibility
    };
}
```

### 3. Key Changes Made
- Added `response` property to the return value of `supplyData`
- Maintained backward compatibility with the `invoke` method
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues with NodeConnectionType constants
- Ensured the model object structure matches LangChain expectations

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed to work:
- The supplyData method now returns both `response` and `invoke` properties
- The BitNet server responds correctly to API calls
- The interface is compatible with LangChain-based nodes

## Usage
After rebuilding n8n with these changes, the BitNet node should now properly connect to the hierarchical summarization node:

1. Add a BitNet node to your workflow
2. Configure it with your BitNet server URL
3. Connect the BitNet "Model" output to the hierarchical summarization node's language model input
4. The connection should now work properly

## Technical Details
- n8n's AI system is built on LangChain
- LangChain nodes expect a specific interface with a `response` property
- The BitNet node now provides this interface while maintaining its original functionality
