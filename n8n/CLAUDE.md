This project is a targeted addition to an existing architecture, being orchestrated via n8n. The Haystack+Elasticsearch integration is now fully implemented and operational.

## Current Status

- **Custom Node**: Built and functional with 8 operations defined (7 working, 1 non-functional)
- **Service**: Running `haystack_service.py` with 7 implemented endpoints
- **Documentation**: Updated in `HAYSTACK_SETUP.md` and `haystack_readme.md`
- **Archived Files**: Old planning documents moved to `archived-docs/`
- **Known Issue**: The "Batch Hierarchy" operation in the n8n node has no corresponding endpoint in the service

The recommended steps for working with the integration are:

## Working with the Haystack Integration

Here are the key steps for using or modifying the Haystack integration:

---

### ✅ Step 1: **Finalize and Build Your Custom Node**

* Ensure your custom node is located in `custom-nodes/` inside your project root (`./custom-nodes/your-node-name`).
* Follow the `n8n-node-starter` structure: each node should have a `node.ts` and an optional `credentials.ts`, and be registered in `package.json`.
* Run:

  ```bash
  cd custom-nodes/your-node-name
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
* This should generate a `dist/` directory with the compiled node code.

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Verify Docker Compose Mount Path**

* In your `docker-compose.yml`, you've already mounted:

  ```yaml
  - ./custom-nodes:/home/node/.n8n/custom
  ```

  This is exactly what’s needed — n8n will look in `/home/node/.n8n/custom` for additional nodes and load them at startup.
* ✅ Confirm this mapping exists and that your built node is located in `./custom-nodes/your-node-name/dist`.

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Update Node Folder to Use Built Files Only**

* Inside `./custom-nodes`, make sure only the `dist` output is being used by n8n, or that the `dist` folder is at the root of each custom node folder.
* If needed, flatten the structure like this:

  ```
  custom-nodes/
    haystack-node/
      dist/
        YourHaystackNode.js
        ...
  ```

  n8n expects either:

  * `custom-nodes/dist/YourNode.js`, or
  * `custom-nodes/haystack-node/dist/YourNode.js`

  You may need to adjust your build or move files accordingly so they are directly accessible within the mount.

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Restart n8n Container to Load Node**

Run the following:

```bash
docker-compose restart n8n
```

* This will cause n8n to scan the `custom` folder and dynamically register any valid `.js` node files it finds.

---

### ✅ Step 5: **Verify Node in n8n Editor**

* Navigate to: [http://localhost:8080/n8n/](http://localhost:8080/n8n/)
* In a new workflow, search for "Haystack Search" in the node palette
* The node provides 8 operations for document management and search (7 functional, 1 non-functional)
---

## Summary

The Haystack integration is functional with:
- 7 service endpoints for document processing
- 8 n8n node operations (7 matching service endpoints, 1 without implementation)
- Complete documentation in HAYSTACK_SETUP.md and haystack_readme.md
- All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- Proper Docker mounting and service configuration

**Note**: The "Batch Hierarchy" operation will fail as it has no corresponding service endpoint.
