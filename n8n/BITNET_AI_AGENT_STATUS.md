# BitNet AI Agent Integration Status

**Document Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: Historical development record - BitNet node is functional but requires manual connection to AI Agent

## Current Situation
BitNet has been successfully integrated into the n8n-nodes-langchain package but doesn't appear in the AI Agent's language model dropdown.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created LangChain-Compatible Node
- File: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain/dist/nodes/llms/LmChatBitNet/LmChatBitNet.node.js`
- Uses ChatOpenAI class with BitNet's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Matches exact structure of other chat models (DeepSeek, Groq, etc.)

### 2. Proper Registration
- Added to package.json nodes array
- Correct output type: `NodeConnectionTypes.AiLanguageModel`
- Proper codex categorization: AI → Language Models → Chat Models (Recommended)

### 3. Docker Integration
- Custom Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.bitnet`) builds n8n image with BitNet included
- Icon file (`bitnet.svg`) copied to correct location
- Package.json updated using jq during build

### 4. Verified File Structure
```
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain/dist/nodes/llms/LmChatBitNet/
├── LmChatBitNet.node.js
└── bitnet.svg
```

## Verification Steps Taken
1. ✅ BitNet directory exists in langchain nodes
2. ✅ BitNet is listed in package.json nodes array
3. ✅ Node file exports correct class structure
4. ✅ supplyData method matches other nodes' signature
5. ✅ Icon file exists
6. ✅ No errors in n8n logs

## Possible Issues

### 1. Node Discovery Mechanism
The AI Agent might use a different mechanism to discover available language models beyond just the package.json registration.

### 2. Runtime Registration
There might be a runtime registration step that happens when n8n starts that we're missing.

### 3. TypeScript Type Definitions
The langchain package might have TypeScript definitions that need updating.

### 4. Version Compatibility
The n8n version (1.98.1) might have specific requirements for langchain nodes.

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Direct Connection (Current Workaround)
While BitNet doesn't appear in the dropdown, you might be able to:
- Add BitNet node to workflow
- Connect it directly to AI Agent's language model input
- This bypasses the dropdown selection

### 2. Fork n8n-nodes-langchain
- Fork the official langchain repository
- Add BitNet properly with all TypeScript definitions
- Build and publish as custom package

### 3. Create Wrapper Node
- Create a custom node that wraps BitNet
- Make it compatible with AI Agent expectations
- Use as bridge between BitNet and AI Agent

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Check TypeScript Definitions**
   - Look for `.d.ts` files that might need updating
   - Check if there's a type registry for available models

2. **Examine AI Agent Source**
   - Understand how it discovers available language models
   - Check if there's a whitelist or registry

3. **Test Direct Connection**
   - Try manually connecting BitNet to AI Agent
   - See if it works despite not being in dropdown

4. **Contact n8n Community**
   - Ask in forums about adding custom langchain nodes
   - Check if others have successfully added custom chat models

## Technical Details

### BitNet Node Configuration
```javascript
{
  displayName: "BitNet Chat Model",
  name: "lmChatBitNet",
  icon: "file:bitnet.svg",
  group: ["transform"],
  version: [1],
  codex: {
    categories: ["AI"],
    subcategories: {
      AI: ["Language Models", "Root Nodes"],
      "Language Models": ["Chat Models (Recommended)"]
    }
  },
  outputs: [NodeConnectionTypes.AiLanguageModel],
  outputNames: ["Model"]
}
```

### Integration Method
Using ChatOpenAI with custom baseURL pointing to BitNet's OpenAI-compatible API:
```javascript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  openAIApiKey: 'dummy-key-for-bitnet',
  modelName: 'bitnet-b1.58-3b',
  temperature: temperature,
  maxTokens: maxTokens,
  configuration: {
    baseURL: serverUrl + '/v1',
  },
});
```

## Conclusion
The BitNet integration is technically correct and follows all patterns of existing langchain chat models. The issue appears to be with n8n's internal discovery mechanism for populating the AI Agent's dropdown menu. Further investigation into n8n's source code or community support may be needed to resolve this final step.
