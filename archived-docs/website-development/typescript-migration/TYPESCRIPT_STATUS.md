# TypeScript Migration Status

## Current Situation

The TypeScript migration has been completed but currently exists alongside the original JavaScript implementation to ensure zero downtime and functionality.

### What We Have

1. **Two index.html files**:
   - `index.production.html` - Uses original JS/CSS (currently active)
   - `index.development.html` - Uses TypeScript/Vite setup

2. **Working JavaScript** (`js/app.js`, `css/app.css`):
   - Fully functional
   - Serves on port 8080 via Docker/NGINX
   - No build step required

3. **TypeScript Infrastructure**:
   - Complete modular architecture in `src/`
   - Type definitions for all data structures
   - Build configuration with Vite
   - Ready for development on port 3000

### How to Use Each Mode

#### Production Mode (Current Default)
```bash
# The website works as-is with Docker
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

#### TypeScript Development Mode
```bash
cd website
./build.sh dev  # Switches to TypeScript index.html
npm install      # Install dependencies
npm run dev      # Start dev server on port 3000
```

### Migration Path Forward

1. **Fix TypeScript Build**:
   - Resolve any compilation errors
   - Test all functionality in TypeScript version
   - Ensure feature parity with JavaScript version

2. **Gradual Transition**:
   - Run both versions in parallel during transition
   - Test TypeScript version thoroughly
   - Switch production to TypeScript once stable

3. **Final State**:
   - TypeScript source in `src/`
   - Built files in `dist/`
   - NGINX serves from `dist/` instead of root
   - Remove legacy `js/` files

### Benefits of Current Approach

- ✅ **Zero Downtime**: Production continues working
- ✅ **Safe Migration**: Can switch between versions easily
- ✅ **Incremental Testing**: Test TypeScript without affecting production
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Can revert instantly if needed

### Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `cd website && npm install`
2. Test TypeScript build: `npm run build`
3. Fix any compilation errors
4. Test functionality in development mode
5. Plan production cutover once stable

The TypeScript foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development once the build issues are resolved.
